preprocessor
	does text replacement
	IE:
		#include <stdio.h>
		#define ARBITRARY 5654.5
		inline int function(){return 0} //'inline' makes the compiler replace the function call with the actual code for the function
		
compiler
	parses the program, performs optimization, and produces assembly code
	//the compiler can optimize the code BUT it may couse an increase in the amount of error
Assembler
	Translates assembly code into machine code
Linker
	Combines object files and libraries into an executable file. It resolves any remaining symbol references
