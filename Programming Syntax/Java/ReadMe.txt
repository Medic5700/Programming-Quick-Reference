Java is a very picky programming language, it will throw many errors when compiling to hlep ensure you don't get run time errors
Java is able to run on many platforms, allowing for coding once, running anywhere

Run/Compile:
	Compiling code will generate java object code
	you then run the java object code
	//usualy the IDE you use will let you do both from within the IDE
