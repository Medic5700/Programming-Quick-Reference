The old command line interface for windows. Quite old, and a little dumb... but it gets the job done and is backwards compatible with old versions of windows (and most likily new versions of windows)
Not really meant for scripting... so the syntax can get quite... difficult sometimes //just give up if you need to do something more advanced then a simple list

Compile/Run:
	command line interpritor, just run the batch file
