Meant as a quick reference for some of the programming languages I've used (and alot that I only kindof started to/wanted to learn) over the years.
It's for those cases where you haven't programmed in a language for years, and you just want to know the syntax of a simple if else.
It's a big mess, and a bit sloppy, but it's proven usefull enough, hopefully it will prove usefull enough to someone else too.
